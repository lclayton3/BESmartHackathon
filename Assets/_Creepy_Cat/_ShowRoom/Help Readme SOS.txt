About the rendering : 

To get the same as the video, you need to download the last unity post effect :
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/releases

Next you can use the pre made setup called : « Post-Processing Profile »

Define your build project to LINEAR and DEFFERED RENDERING.

Do not hesitate to try the SCREEN SPACE REFLEXION (In this case you need to 
deactivate all reflexions probes)

Regards
